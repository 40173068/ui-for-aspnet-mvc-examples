Grid popup editing with a MultiSelect
==========================

This demo shows how to edit a complex object in a POPUP edit mode. In general, the widget will build the editor form automatically for you, but it won't include complex object fields. This is the default and expected ASP.NET MVC behavior [link](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/aspnet-mvc-2-templates-part-4-custom-object-templates.html).

To overcome this ASP.NET MVC limitation, we will need to define [a custom model editor form](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/aspnet-mvc/helpers/grid/editor-templates). This is what this demo do.
